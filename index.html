        <p >In this series of visualizations, we turn our attention to a pivotal aspect of road safety in Australia â€“ car crashes. 
          Over the span of two decades, from 1998 to 2021, this analysis delves into the nuances of road accidents within the nation. 
          This exploration unveils critical insights into accident frequency, trends, and the impact of road safety measures, 
          in Australia's diverse geography. I aim to provide an
           understanding of car accidents and their implications in Australia, shedding light on regions that have made strides 
          in improving road safety and those that continue to grapple with persistent challenges. <b>Hover over visualizations for tooltips.</b></p>

          <p>The choropleth map of Australia vividly illustrates the frequency of road 
            traffic accidents from 1998 to 2021, with each of Australia's states being color-coded to represent 
            the number of crashes. It is immediately apparent that New South Wales consistently stands out as the state with 
            the highest number of crashes over this extensive period. 
            <br><br>This visualization shows the need for continued efforts in road safety, especially in New South Wales, and emphasizes 
            the importance of comprehensive measures to reduce traffic accidents across the nation.
          Due to the low population and hence lower number of drivers in Northern territory and Tasmania, 
          these states have much lower counts of car crashes. <br><br>We can see that the scale changes as we move through the years with the slider
          as the total number of crashes each year decreases. <b>Drag the slider to go through the years.</b></p>

          <p>The 2D histogram scatterplot illustrates the frequency of road accidents per state per time of day. 
            Each circle represents a state and the approximate time of day. 
            The size of the circles represents the number of crashes.
            We can see that <b>the majority of crashes occur at around 3pm for all states</b>, with the highest number of crashes occurring in New South Wales.
            We can see that there is a trend of more crashes occurring in the afternoon and evening, with the least number of crashes occurring in the early morning.</p>

          other day.</p>

          <p>This line chart shows the trend of car crashes over the years. We can see that the number of crashes has been decreasing over the years. 
            We can see that the state with the most crashes in 1998 was New South Wales, and this trend has continued over the years however 
            the number of crashes has decreased significantly to the point of matching with Queensland in 2021.
            This downward trend of crashes in all states can be attributed to the introduction of new safety features in cars and the introduction of new road safety laws. 
            This may also be attributed to the advancement of technology in cars and traffic.
